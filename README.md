This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

<br>

### First, make a local copy of the env

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

<br>

### Update the `.env` file to add required parameters you'll find instructions on the file.

<br>

### Now, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

```bash
npm run lint
# or
