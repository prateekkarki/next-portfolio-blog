# Heavy Computation Made Lighter: React Memoization

React memoization is a powerful technique that can significantly improve the performance of your applications by preventing unnecessary re-renders and expensive calculations.

## What is Memoization?

Memoization is an optimization technique that stores the results of expensive function calls and returns the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

## React.memo for Component Memoization

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {
  // Expensive computation here
  const processedData = heavyComputation(data);
  
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
});
```

## useMemo for Value Memoization

```jsx
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

function MyComponent({ items }) {
  const sortedItems = useMemo(() => {
    return items.sort((a, b) => a.name.localeCompare(b.name));
  }, [items]);
  
  return <div>{sortedItems.map(item => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}</div>;
}
```

## useCallback for Function Memoization

```jsx
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';

function ParentComponent() {
  const handleClick = useCallback((id) => {
    console.log('Item clicked:', id);
  }, []);
  
  return <ChildComponent onItemClick={handleClick} />;
}
```

## When to Use Memoization

- **React.memo**: When components receive the same props frequently
- **useMemo**: For expensive calculations that depend on specific values
- **useCallback**: For functions passed as props to child components

## Performance Benefits

- Reduced re-renders
- Faster component updates
- Better user experience
- Lower CPU usage

## Best Practices

1. Only memoize when necessary
2. Monitor performance improvements
3. Use React DevTools Profiler
4. Consider the cost of memoization itself

## Conclusion

React memoization is an essential tool for optimizing performance in React applications. Use it wisely to create faster, more responsive user interfaces.
